              I have a genuine love for technology and how it helps to better
              the world through connection and innovation - and I'm beyond

              same way.

          <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
          <!-- general description, my love of web and why -->

          <p>
            Since my first login, I've always had a penchant for navigating
            computer systems. The purposeful shift from restaurant industry to
            the medical field in 2017 gave me an opportunity to further explore
            my tech skills, and fulfill my drive to improve the lives of others.

            As the go-to person for error messages, website tweaks and needed
            fixes when IT isn't around, I know that I want to learn and
            accomplish much more. Now that I have signed up for the Thinkful
            Engineering Immersion program, I am taking important steps to making
            this goal a reality.

                enjoyed video games as well. I'm currently into first person
                survival style games that involve puzzles - Outer Wilds is a
                personal favorite. I also enjoy singing, painting, and
                trying/making new foods.

            My past work history has always involved working with a closely knit
            team. While I have been able to manage and complete tasks in
            solitude, cooperation and collaboration can be paramount in
            successfully achieving goals. As someone new and enthusiastic to the
            field I would love to meet and work with others that have the same
            passion... whether that be teammates to embrace growth and learning
            with, or a mentor for guidance.

                Stephen King once said "There's no harm in hoping for the best
                as long as you're prepared for the worst." I ran with those
                words of wisdom and created my own 404 page as soon as I knew
                how. Hopefully you never have to see it outside of this
                presentation!
