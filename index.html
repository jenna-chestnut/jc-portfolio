<h4>Hi there! I'm Jenna and I'm a web developer (in the making) living in Nashville, Tennessee.</h4>
  <p>I have a genuine love for technology and how it helps to better the world through connection and innovation 
    - and I'm beyond excited to meet, collaborate and learn with others who feel the same way.</p>
  I hope you enjoy my website, and please don't hesitate to send a message. Don't forget to <a href="#contact me">follow me</a>!

    <h3>ABOUT ME</h3> <!-- general description, my love of web and why -->

  <p>Since my first login, I've always had a penchant for navigating computer systems. 
    The purposeful shift from restaurant industry to the medical field in 2017 
    gave me an opportunity to further explore my tech skills, 
    and fulfill my drive to improve the lives of others. </p>
  
  <p class="bottomspace">As the go-to person for error messages, website tweaks and needed fixes when IT isn't around, 
    I know that I want to learn and accomplish much more. 
    Now that I have signed up for the Thinkful Engineering Immersion program, 
    I am taking important steps to making this goal a reality.</p>

      <h4 class="center">OUTSIDE OF TECH</h4> <!-- personality outside of work -->
        During my down time, I love exploring in nature and hiking with my dog 
        <a href="https://gdurl.com/cHqw" target="_blank">Salem</a>! I love taking pictures and have a Nikon D3300. 
        I've always enjoyed video games as well. I'm currently into first person survival style games that involve puzzles - Outer Wilds is a personal favorite.
        I also enjoy singing, painting, and trying/making new foods.

  <p>My past work history has always involved working with a closely knit team. 
    While I have been able to manage and complete tasks in solitude, 
    cooperation and collaboration can be paramount in successfully achieving goals.
    As someone new and enthusiastic to the field I would love to meet and work with others 
    that have the same passion... whether that be teammates to embrace growth and learning with, or a mentor for guidance.</p>

<h4>PERSONAL 404 PAGE</h4>
  <p>Stephen King once said "There's no harm in hoping for the best as long as you're prepared for the worst."
  I ran with those words of wisdom and created my own 404 page as soon as I knew how. 
  Hopefully you never have to see it outside of this presentation!</p>
  <p>For this page, I utilized HTML and CSS.</p>
